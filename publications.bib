	abstract = {There are a lot of new sentiment words appear in Weibo platform every day in the web2.0. As the unpredictable polarity of massive new words are detrimental to sentiment analysis for Weibo, hence how to extract new sentiment words and expand sentiment lexicon is of great importance. Therefore, we propose a relative branch entropy based method, which combines word frequency and adjacent words information to extract new sentiment word in Weibo. After integrated context and other factors, this method improves the accuracy of new sentiment word recognition. Three experiments are implemented on COAE 2014 Weibo corpus to compare the performance of different statistics with the proposed method. Experiment results show that the proposed method has a high accuracy, which demonstrates the effectiveness of this method and verify the promoted effect of new sentiment word extraction on the performance of Weibo sentiment classification. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

	abstract = {Conferences have a significant impact on the academic world. Academic conferences aim to exchange information about research results with others. The quality of the conference is highly considered because it involves the credibility of the research papers produced. Creating a ranking system is an effective way to measure conference quality and compare it with other venues. The existing conference ranking systems do not have a unified index or are still manually evaluated by humans, so there is a gap to create an academic conference evaluation system that is objective, comprehensive, and universal. To further improve the ranking system, we propose two new indicators in this work. In these two indicators, we quantify the attractiveness of conferences and combine them with the traditional three indicators to calculate the scores of 10 conferences in the field of data science through the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) model. The proposed new evaluation system can help authors understand conferences more comprehensively and screen conferences more sensibly. © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Metaphor involves not only a linguistic phenomenon, but also a cognitive phenomenon structuring human thought, which makes understanding it challenging. As a means of cognition, metaphor is rendered by more than texts alone, and multimodal information in which vision/audio content is integrated with the text can play an important role in expressing and understanding metaphor. However, previous metaphor processing and understanding has focused on texts, partly due to the unavailability of large-scale datasets with ground truth labels of multimodal metaphor. In this paper, we introduce MultiMET, a novel multimodal metaphor dataset to facilitate understanding metaphorical information from multimodal text and image. It contains 10,437 text-image pairs from a range of sources with multimodal annotations of the occurrence of metaphors, domain relations, sentiments metaphors convey, and author intents. MultiMET opens the door to automatic metaphor understanding by investigating multimodal cues and their interplay. Moreover, we propose a range of strong baselines and show the importance of combining multimodal cues for metaphor understanding.

	abstract = {Facial appearance matters in social networks. Individuals frequently make trait judgments from facial clues. Although these face-based impressions lack the evidence to determine validity, they are of vital importance, because they may relate to human network-based social behavior, such as seeking certain individuals for help, advice, dating, and cooperation, and thus they may relate to centrality in social networks. However, little to no work has investigated the apparent facial traits that influence network centrality, despite the large amount of research on attributions of the central position including personality and behavior. In this paper, we examine whether perceived traits based on facial appearance affect network centrality by exploring the initial stage of social network formation in a first-year college residential area. We took face photos of participants who are freshmen living in the same residential area, and we asked them to nominate community members linking to different networks. We then collected facial perception data by requiring other participants to rate facial images for three main attributions: dominance, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. Meanwhile, we proposed a framework to discover how facial appearance affects social networks. Our results revealed that perceived facial traits were correlated with the network centrality and that they were indicative to predict the centrality of people in different networks. Our findings provide psychological evidence regarding the interaction between faces and network centrality. Our findings also offer insights in to a combination of psychological and social network techniques, and they highlight the function of facial bias in cuing and signaling social traits. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the influence of facial perception on centrality in social networks. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.},

Therefore, we propose a globality-locality preserving maximum variance extreme learning machine (GLELM) based on manifold learning. Based on the characteristics of the traditional ELM method, GLELM introduces the basic principles of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and local preservation projection (LPP) into ELM, fully taking account of the discriminant information contained in the sample. This method can preserve the global and local manifold structures of data to optimize the projection direction of the classifier. Experiments on several widely used image databases and UCI datasets validate the performance of GLELM. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves promising results compared to several state-of-the-art ELM algorithms. © 2019 Yonghe Chu et al.},

	abstract = {Metaphor is a pervasive aspect of human communication, and its presence in multimodal forms has become more prominent with the progress of mass media. However, there is a scarcity of research focusing on multimodal metaphor resources in languages other than English, despite the evident variations in how different languages express multimodal metaphors. Furthermore, the existing work in natural language processing does not address the exploration of categorizing the source and target domains in metaphors. This omission is significant considering the extensive research conducted in the fields of cognitive linguistics, which emphasizes that a profound understanding of metaphor relies on recognizing the differences and similarities between domain categories. We, therefore, introduce MultiCMET, a multimodal Chinese metaphor dataset, consisting of 13,820 text-image pairs of advertisements with manual annotations of the occurrence of metaphors, source and target domain categories, and sentiments metaphors convey. Furthermore, we have developed a domain lexicon that encompasses categorizations of domains and corresponding examples. We propose the Cascading Domain Knowledge Integration (CDKI) benchmark, which utilizes domain-specific features from the domain lexicon to enhance the understanding of metaphors. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CDKI. The dataset and code are publicly available. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

	abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task that aims to predict the sentiment polarity of a specific aspect. Recent work adopts graph convolutional networks over dependency trees to capture the syntactic connections of aspects and opinion words while introducing the BiAffine to jointly refine syntax structures and semantic correlations. However, in the Euclidean space, the neural network models can't well capture the syntactic connections of aspects and opinion words due to the inaccurate dependency trees representation, and the original structures and correlations are affected due to the BiAffine exchange method. Fortunately, dependency trees can be represented well since hyperbolic space can be viewed as continuous simulations of trees, so we propose a hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (HyperGCN) model to handle these challenges. We employ hyperbolic graph convolution with the dependency tree to model syntactic connections between aspects and opinion words, additionally, we also capture the semantic correlations with a hyperbolic graph convolutional network incorporating self-attention mechanism. Particularly, to exchange the relevant features without original syntax structures and semantic correlations being affected, we leverage an attention mechanism with residual structure to exchange relevant features of syntactic and semantic information. The experimental results on three datasets verify the effectiveness of our model.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Facial perception is of significant influence on the positions of people in social networks. Particularly, students' facial traits can affect their social centrality in educational settings (e.g., students looking intelligent can attract more friends). However, in educational environments, the social biases associated with appearances have alarming consequences, and little research has been done to investigate the effect of facial perception on social networks. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the influence of perceived facial traits on students' status in social interaction. In this article, we explore the effect of facial perception on the social centrality of students in social networks. Because students' social centrality is based on both their study ability and facial traits, this study does a comparative analysis of how facial perception and academic performance influence the social centrality of students. Subsequently, the experimental results demonstrate that facial perception, as well as academic performance, closely correlates with the social centrality of students. Finally, this study contributes to a comprehensive and deep understanding of social networks by analyzing facial trait-based social biases.  © 2014 IEEE.},

Numerous approaches to sentiment analysis of metaphors have thus gained attention in natural language processing (NLP). The primary focus of these approaches is on linguistic features and text rather than other modal information and data. However, visual features such as facial expressions also play an important role in expressing sentiments. In this paper, we present a novel neural network approach to sentiment analysis of metaphorical expressions that combines both linguistic and visual features and refer to it as the multimodal model approach. For this, we create a Chinese dataset, containing textual data from metaphorical sentences along with visual data on synchronized facial images. The experimental results indicate that our multimodal model outperforms several other linguistic and visual models, and also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The contribution is realized in terms of novelty of the approach and creation of a new, sizeable, and scarce dataset with linguistic and synchronized facial expressive image data. The dataset is particularly useful in languages other than English and the approach addresses one of the most challenging NLP issue: sentiment analysis in metaphor. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Among the most disabling disorders, mental illness is one that affects millions of people across the world. Although a great deal of research has been done to prevent mental disorders, detecting mental illness in potential patients remains a considerable challenge. This paper proposes a novel metaphor-based approach (MAM) to determine whether a social media user has a mental disorder or not by classifying social media texts. We observe that the social media texts posted by people with mental illness often contain many implicit emotions that metaphors can express. Therefore, we extract these texts’ metaphor features as the primary indicator for the text classification task. Our approach firstly proposes a CNN-RNN (Convolution Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) framework to enable the representations of long texts. The metaphor features are then applied to the attention mechanism for achieving the metaphorical emotions-based mental illness detection. Subsequently, compared with other works, our approach achieves creative results in the detection of mental illnesses. The recall scores of MAM on depression, anorexia, and suicide detection are the highest, with 0.50, 0.70, and 0.65, respectively. Furthermore, MAM has the best F1 scores on depression and anorexia detection tasks, with 0.51 and 0.71. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

With the development of the Internet and the emergence of massive texts, automatic recognition of metaphorical texts using natural language processing technology has become an urgent need. However, in the current Chinese metaphor recognition research, due to the limited research resources, the model is easy to overfit. In addition, mainstream metaphor recognition methods have the problem of poor interpretability. In response to the above problems, this paper constructs a large-scale Chinese verb metaphor data set, and proposes an unsupervised Chinese verb metaphor recognition model based on HowNet. Experimental results show that the model proposed in this paper can be effectively applied to the task of verb metaphor recognition, and the recognition effect exceeds that of the unsupervised model. Moreover, compared with other deep learning models for metaphor recognition, the model in this paper has the advantages of simple structure, fewer parameters, and strong interpretability. © 2021 China National Conference on Computational Linguistics Published under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License},

Prior work on the analysis of humor focuses on whether text is humorous or not, or the degree of funniness, but this is insufficient to explain why it is funny. We therefore create a dataset on humor with 9,123 manually annotated jokes in Chinese. We propose a novel annotation scheme to give scenarios of how humor arises in text. Specifically, our annotations of linguistic humor not only contain the degree of funniness, like previous work, but they also contain key words that trigger humor as well as character relationship, scene, and humor categories. We report reasonable agreement between annotators. We also conduct an analysis and exploration of the dataset. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach humor annotation for exploring the underlying mechanism of the use of humor, which may contribute to a significantly deeper analysis of humor.

Traditional humor computing research mainly focuses on the content, while neglecting the information of interaction relationships in social media. In addition, both content and users are important in social media, while existing humor computing research mainly focuses on content rather than people. To address these problems, we model the information transfer and entity interactions in social media as a heterogeneous graph, and create the first dataset which introduces the social context information - HumorWB1, which is collected from Chinese social media - Weibo. Two humor-related tasks are designed in the dataset. One is a content-oriented humor recognition task, and the other is a novel humor evaluation task. For the above tasks, we purpose a graph-based model called SCOG, which uses heterogeneous graph neural networks to optimize node representation for downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of feature extraction and graph representation learning methods in the model, as well as the necessity of introducing social context information. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.},

Metaphor identification plays a significant preliminary role in the field of machine translation, reading comprehension, and automatic summarization, making it a focus of natural language processing. Recently, research into Chinese verb metaphor identification has become a widespread concern. The main problem is that the usage of semantic resources is relatively simple, and there is a lack of deep semantic support. Therefore, this paper proposes a word representation method suitable for metaphor classification tasks, which combines the traditional word vector with structural information from the Synonym Thesaurus, so that the word vector can contain the abstraction degree of the word in the metaphor. On this basis, we propose a verb metaphor attention network based on subject-predicate and verb-object relationships, which gives full consideration to the global syntactic information when we perform LSTM encoding and calculate the weight of each word. At the same time, it can facilitate the understanding of literalness and non-literalness. The experimental results show that the identification effect improves on the existing results, indicating that word representation combining semantic resources and attention network can improve the verb metaphor identification performance. © 2013 IEEE.},

Recently, researchers have proposed related research algorithms to accommodate noise and outlier data. With a proper fuzzy membership function, a fuzzy ELM can effectively reduce the effects of outliers when solving the classification problem. However, how to apply ELM for learning and accuracy in the presence of noise is still an important research topic. A novel fuzzy ELM (ANFELM) technique is proposed in this paper. In the algorithm, the membership degree of the sample is calculated in a feature mapping space instead of the data input space. The algorithm provides good performance in reducing the effects of outliers and significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization. Experiments on UCI datasets and textual datasets show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the classification capability of ELM and is superior to other algorithms. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In writing, meaningful metaphorical expressions can enhance the literariness and creativity of texts. Therefore, the usage of metaphor is a significant impact factor when assessing the creativity and literariness of writing. However, little to no automatic writing assessment system considers metaphorical expressions when giving the score of creativity. For improving the accuracy of automatic writing assessment, this paper proposes a novel creativity assessment model that imports a token-level metaphor identification method to extract metaphors as the indicators for creativity scoring. The experimental results show that our model can accurately assess the creativity of different texts with precise metaphor identification.

	abstract = {Current methods of toxic language detection (TLD) typically rely on specific tokens to conduct decisions, which makes them suffer from lexical bias, leading to inferior performance and generalization. Lexical bias has both “useful” and “misleading” impacts on understanding toxicity. Unfortunately, instead of distinguishing between these impacts, current debiasing methods typically eliminate them indiscriminately, resulting in a degradation in the detection accuracy of the model. To this end, we propose a Counterfactual Causal Debiasing Framework (CCDF) to mitigate lexical bias in TLD. It preserves the “useful impact” of lexical bias and eliminates the “misleading impact”. Specifically, we first represent the total effect of the original sentence and biased tokens on decisions from a causal view. We then conduct counterfactual inference to exclude the direct causal effect of lexical bias from the total effect. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the debiased TLD model incorporating CCDF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and fairness compared to competitive baselines applied on several vanilla models. The generalization capability of our model outperforms current debiased models for out-of-distribution data. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.},

In this paper, we proposed a new method based on the discriminative locality preserving broad learning system (DPBLS) for hyperspectral image classification by exploiting the manifold structure between neighbouring pixels of hyperspectral image. To make full use of the spectral and spatial information of hyperspectral images.we firstly leverage edge-preserving filters to fuse both spectral and spatial features of hyperspectral image samples. Secondly, we introduce discriminative information and local manifold structure of samples into the broad learning system to enhance the discriminative ability of output weights and improve its performance on hyperspectral image classification task. In order to verify the performance of the framework proposed in this paper, we conducted experiments on four hyperspectral image datasets. experiment results show that the method we proposed is well-performed on hyperspectral image classification tasks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

As a general sentence regression architecture, extractive text summarization captures sentences from a document by leveraging externally related information. However, existing sentence regression approaches have not employed features that mine the contextual information and relations among sentences. To alleviate this problem, we present a neural network model, namely the Contextualized-Representation Hierarchical-Attention Summarization (CRHASum), that uses the contextual information and relations among sentences to improve the sentence regression performance for extractive text summarization. This framework makes the most of their advantages. One advantage is that the contextual representation is allowed to vary across linguistic context information, and the other advantage is that the hierarchical attention mechanism is able to capture the contextual relations from the word-level and sentence-level by using the Bi-GRU. With this design, the CRHASum model is capable of paying attention to the important context in the surrounding context of a given sentence for extractive text summarization. We carry out extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. CRHASum alone can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art approach. Meanwhile, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of multiple ROUNG metrics and includes a few basic useful features. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

However, there is little research on the construction of metaphor corpora annotated with emotion for the analysis of emotionality of metaphorical expressions. Furthermore, most studies focus on English, and few in other languages, particularly Sino-Tibetan languages such as Chinese, for emotion analysis from metaphorical texts, although there are likely to be many differences in emotional expressions of metaphorical usages across different languages. We therefore construct a significant new corpus on metaphor, with 5,605 manually annotated sentences in Chinese. We present an annotation scheme that contains annotations of linguistic metaphors, emotional categories (joy, anger, sadness, fear, love, disgust and surprise), and intensity. The annotation agreement analyses for multiple annotators are described. We also use the corpus to explore and analyze the emotionality of metaphors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first relatively large metaphor corpus with an annotation of emotions in Chinese. © 2018 Association for Computational Linguistics},

While the literature focused on analysing the relationship between mental health and a single factor such as personality or behavior, accurate prediction is yet to be achieved due to the lack of cross-dimensional analysis and multi-dimensional joint prediction. To this end, this work proposes leveraging multiple factors from three crucial dimensions of mental health: behaviors, personality, and social networks. We recruited 490 college students, and collected their behavioral records from smart cards. In addition, we extracted their psychological traits from questionnaires, and social networks by conducting the survey on the nominating community members. We created a neural network-based model to integrate behavioral, psychological, and social network factors to predict mental health problems. The experimental results verify the efficacy of the proposed model, and demonstrate that the classification model of various factors effectively predicts the students' mental issues. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The failure of landing a job for college students could cause serious social consequences such as drunkenness and suicide. In addition to academic performance, unconscious biases can become one key obstacle for hunting jobs for graduating students. Thus, it is necessary to understand these unconscious biases so that we can help these students at an early stage with more personalized intervention. In this paper, we develop a framework, i.e., MAYA (Multi-mAjor emploYment stAtus) to predict students’ employment status while considering biases. The framework consists of four major components. Firstly, we solve the heterogeneity of student courses by embedding academic performance into a unified space. Then, we apply a generative adversarial network (GAN) to overcome the class imbalance problem. Thirdly, we adopt Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with a novel dropout mechanism to comprehensively capture sequential information among semesters. Finally, we design a bias-based regularization to capture the job market biases. We conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale educational dataset and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our prediction framework.

Sixty-seven participants rated the dominance, emotion, and trustworthiness of 24 faces posing with different head tilts while maintaining eye gaze at the camera. Both the 30° up and 20° down head postures were perceived as less trustworthy and more dominant (less submissive) than the head-level posture. Change in perceived trustworthiness and submissiveness with head tilt correlated with change in apparent emotional positivity but not change in facial width. Hence, our analysis suggests that apparent emotional expression provides a better explanation of perceived trustworthiness and dominance compared with cues to facial structure. © The Author(s) 2020.},

A recently developed algorithm, density peaks (DP) clustering, demonstrates great robustness to the complex structural variations of WM tracts without any prior templates. Nevertheless, the calculation of densities, the core step of DP, is time consuming especially when the number of WM fibers is huge. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm that accelerates the density computation about 50 times over the original one. We convert the global calculation for the density as well as critical parameter in the process into local computations, and develop a binary tree structure to orderly store the neighbors for these local computations. Hence, the density computation turns out to direct access of the structure, rendering significantly computational saving. Experiments on synthetic point data and the JHU-DTI data set validate the efficiency and effectiveness our fast DP algorithm compared with existing clustering methods. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed algorithm on the analysis of pediatric WM tract development. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

However, there remains a major challenge: it is difficult for ELM algorithms to maintain the manifold structure and the discriminant information contained in the data. To address this issue, we propose a discriminant globality-locality preserving extreme learning machine (DGLELM) in this paper. In contrast to ELM, DGLELM not only considers the global discriminative structure of the dataset but also makes the best use of the local discriminative geometry information. DGLELM optimizes the projection direction of the ELM output weights by maximizing the inter-class dispersion and minimizing the intra-class dispersion for global and local data. Experiments on several widely used image databases validate the performance of DGLELM. The experimental results show that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ELM algorithms. © 2019},

Our network can automatically capture useful information from news on stock market without any handcrafted feature. In our network, we first introduce an entity embedding layer to automatically learn entity embedding using financial news. We then use a convolutional layer to extract key information affecting stock market trend, and use a long short-term memory neural network to learn context-dependent relations in financial news for stock market trend prediction.

	abstract = {Background: The number of biomedical research articles have increased exponentially with the advancement of biomedicine in recent years. These articles have thus brought a great difficulty in obtaining the needed information of researchers. Information retrieval technologies seek to tackle the problem. However, information needs cannot be completely satisfied by directly introducing the existing information retrieval techniques. Therefore, biomedical information retrieval not only focuses on the relevance of search results, but also aims to promote the completeness of the results, which is referred as the diversity-oriented retrieval. Results: We address the diversity-oriented biomedical retrieval task using a supervised term ranking model. The model is learned through a supervised query expansion process for term refinement. Based on the model, the most relevant and diversified terms are selected to enrich the original query. The expanded query is then fed into a second retrieval to improve the relevance and diversity of search results. To this end, we propose three diversity-oriented optimization strategies in our model, including the diversified term labeling strategy, the biomedical resource-based term features and a diversity-oriented group sampling learning method. Experimental results on TREC Genomics collections demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in improving the relevance and the diversity of search results. Conclusions: The proposed three strategies jointly contribute to the improvement of biomedical retrieval performance. Our model yields more relevant and diversified results than the state-of-the-art baseline models. Moreover, our method provides a general framework for improving biomedical retrieval performance, and can be used as the basis for future work. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Previous research has tested whether culture moderates the relationship between head tilt and perceptions of a cooperation-relevant construct. In this paper, we replicated the effects of head posture on perceived traits and compared Chinese and American participants to explore whether difference in cultural background (collectivist and individualist) affects perceptual attribution. Specifically, we investigated how head posture (level, up or down) affects perceptions of cooperativeness. In Experiment 1, Chinese and American participants rated Asian and Caucasian faces in three postures for perceived cooperativeness on a seven-point Likert scale. In Experiment 2, participants ranked the cooperativeness of the three postures of the same faces. In Experiment 3, participants scrolled through face images and manually manipulated vertical head angle to maximise apparent cooperativeness. We found that for both Chinese and American participants a neutral head level posture was perceived as more cooperative than head up and down postures. The optimal head posture for maximised apparent cooperativeness was close to level but with a slight downward rotation. While there was cross-cultural consistency in perceptions, Chinese participants exhibited greater sensitivity to postural cues in their judgments of cooperation compared to American participants. Our results suggest a profound effect of posture on the perception of cooperativeness that is common across cultures and that there are additional subtle cross-cultural differences in the cues to cooperativeness. © 2022 The Authors},

It is important and difficult research to recognize the heterographic pun because of the ambiguity.

For pronunciation, we exploit the hierarchical attention model with phoneme embedding. While for spelling, we consider the character-level, word-level, tag-level, position-level and contextual-level embedding with attention model. To deal with the two parts, we present a gated attention mechanism to control the information integration. We have conducted extensive experiments on SemEval2017 task7 and Pun of the Day datasets. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.},

In particular, three significant concepts of Vyogtsky's theory: self-regulation, the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), and scaffolding all of which have been discussed in numerous second language acquisition (SLA) and second language learning (SLL) research papers. These concepts lay the psychological foundation for collaborative learning, the subject of this paper. This publication aims to examine SCT by assessing collaborative learning within the Chinese context. This paper focuses on teacher-student collaboration and it concludes that the perceived way of learning and teaching and teacher-student relationship should be changed in order to implement collaborative learning. © Canadian Center of Science and Education.},

	abstract = {Mental health problems are prevalent and an important issue in medicine. However, clinical diagnosis of mental health problems is costly, time-consuming, and often significantly delayed, which highlights the need for novel methods to identify them. Previous psycholinguistic and psychiatry research has suggested that the use of metaphors in texts is linked to the mental health status of the authors. In this paper, we propose a method for automatically detecting metaphors in texts to predict various mental health problems, specifically anxiety, depression, inferiority, sensitivity, social phobias, and obsession. We perform experiments on a composition dataset collected from second-language students and on the eRisk2017 dataset collected from Social Media. The experimental results show that our approach can help predict mental health problems in authors of written texts, and our algorithm performs better than other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we report that the use of metaphors even in nonnative languages can be indicative of various mental health problems.  © 2021 Nan Shi et al.},

	abstract = {Classmate friendships are a major aspect of university social experience. Taking classes together is one of the main ways for students to build friendships. Consequently, class-level friendship networks have attracted tremendous attention from researchers. They are also very useful in student support and early intervention. However, these networks are normally invisible for educators. Discovering such an important web of students effectively is a pressing problem. Against this background, we propose a data-driven framework called CANDY which automatically discovers the class-level friendship networks based on educational big data. We first represent features through representation learning methods. Secondly, the data is augmented with the randomly shuffling method. Thirdly, a conditional generative adversarial network model is used to mine the class-level friendship networks. A deep adversarial optimization strategy is proposed here for problems caused by network sparsity. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we build a real-world dataset that contains rich student information. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Ancient Chinese poetry is the earliest literary genre that took shape in Chinese literature and has a dissemination effect, showing China's profound cultural heritage. The current work in the field of poetry generation is mainly aimed at improving the fluency and structural accuracy of words and sentences, ignoring the theme unity of poetry generation results. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network poetry theme representation model based on label embedding. Based on the network representation of poetry, the topic feature representation of poetry is constructed and learned from the granularity of words. Then, the features of the poetry theme representation model are combined with the autoregressive language model to construct a theme-oriented ancient Chinese poetry generation model TLPG (Poetry Generation with Theme Label). Through experiment and evaluation by experts in related fields, the model proposed in this paper has significantly improved the topic consistency on the premise of ensuring the fluency and format accuracy of poetry. © 2023 Incoma Ltd.

	abstract = {Network representation learning (NRL) is a matter of importance to a variety of tasks such as link prediction. Learning low-dimensional vector representations for node enhancement based on nodes attributes and network structures can improve link prediction performance. Node attributes are important factors in forming networks, like psychological factors and appearance features affecting friendship networks. However, little to no work has detected friendship using the NRL technique, which combines students’ psychological features and perceived traits based on facial appearance. In this paper, we propose a framework named DEFINE (No enhancement based r e dship D tection) to detect students’ friend relationships, which combines with students’ psychological factors and facial perception information. To detect friend relationships accurately, DEFINE uses the NRL technique, which considers network structure and the additional attributes information for nodes. DEFINE transforms them into low-dimensional vector spaces while preserving the inherent properties of the friendship network. Experimental results on real-world friendship network datasets illustrate that DEFINE outperforms other state-of-art methods. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

[Methods] First, we used keywords extraction algorithms to map metaphor documents into keyword sets. Then, we chose effective features as parameters for the regression models, which helped us predict the frequency of trending words in the next year. Finally, we analyzed the developments of metaphor research diachronically and synchronously. [Results] Our study compared the results of five regression models. Among them, the GBR model with the best fitting degree had the highest prediction accuracy for next year’s trending words. The feature ablation experiment also confirmed that our selected features were effective. [Limitations] The accuracy of keyword extraction algorithm could be optimized. [Conclusions] Metaphor research is developing towards the direction of cross-domains and inter-disciplines. The method of feature selection provides more references for research in prediction models. © 2022, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The lungs and skin are important respiratory organs in Anura, but the pulmonary structure of amphibians remains unclear due to the lack of a suitable procedure. This study improved the procedure used for fixing lungs tissues and used light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy to reveal the differences in the lung and skin morphologies between Pelophylax nigromaculatus (P. nigromaculatus) and Bufo gargarizans (B. gargarizans). In P. nigromaculatus and B. gargarizans, the cystic lungs comprise a continuous outer pulmonary wall on which primary, secondary, and tertiary septa attach, and a number of regular lattices form from raised capillaries and the pulmonary epithelium on the surfaces of the pulmonary wall and septa. Each lattice in P. nigromaculatus consists of several elliptical sheets and flat bottom, and the septa are distributed with denser sheets and have a larger stretching range than the pulmonary wall. The lattice in B. gargarizans consists of thick folds and an uneven bottom with several thin folds, and the septa have more developed thick and thin folds than the pulmonary wall. However, the density of the pulmonary microvilli, the area of a single capillary, the thicknesses of the blood-air barrier, pulmonary wall and septum, and the lung/body weight percentage obtained for B. gargarizans were higher than those found for P. nigromaculatus. In P. nigromaculatus, the dorsal skin has dense capillaries and a ring surface structure with mucus layer on the stratum corneum, and the ventral skin is slightly keratinized. In B. gargarizans, the stratum corneum in both the dorsal and ventral skins is completely keratinized. A fine ultrastructure analysis of P. nigromaculatus and B. gargarizans revealed that the pulmonary septa are more developed than the pulmonary walls, which means that the septa have a stronger respiratory function. The more developed lungs are helpful for the adaptation of B. gargarizans to drought environments, whereas P. nigromaculatus has to rely on more vigorous skin respiration to adapt to a humid environment. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Metaphorical expressions are frequently used to convey emotions in human communication. However, there is limited research on the detection of emotionality in metaphorical expressions, although a number of studies have focused on sentiment analysis and metaphor detection separately. We, therefore, attempt to identify emotions in Chinese metaphorical texts. We first construct a manual corpus with an annotation scheme, which contains annotations of metaphor, and emotional categories. We then use the corpus as a train-and-test set to identify the emotions in metaphorical expressions automatically with three methods. The first method is based on a field dictionary and field conflict. The second method is based on a support vector machine. The third method is based on deep learning, and it applies the long short-term memory model to identify the emotion of metaphor. The experimental results show that the third method performs better in identifying metaphor tasks, while the first method works better for emotion classification. In this paper, we compared the strength of heuristic, stochastic, and deep learning approaches, which contributes to a challenging natural language processing issue: the detection of emotionality in metaphor. © 2018 IEEE.},
